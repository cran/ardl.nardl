Description: Estimate the linear and nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL & NARDL) models and the corresponding error correction models, and test for longrun and short-run asymmetric. The general-to-specific approach is also available in estimating the ARDL and NARDL models. The Pesaran, Shin & Smith (2001) (<doi:10.1002/jae.616>) bounds test for level relationships is also provided. The 'ardl.nardl' package also performs short-run and longrun symmetric restrictions available at Shin et al. (2014) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4899-8008-3_9> and their corresponding tests.
